	Yesterday : 
		I completed the initial JugPuzzle Model classes
	
	Today     : Add Scrum framework documents to project. Proofread 
		        and post the assignment. Send message to all students
		        about the availability of the assignment.
	
	Obstacles : Started the assignment. Made JugButtonActionListener, JugPuzzleGUIController and JugView. Cannot figure out how to
				implement action even for interaction between two buttons (spill to and from). Also cannot figure out why the "view"
				would not show up in my GUI. Added setChanged and notifyObserver methods to JugPuzzle.Got halfway done implementing
				a simple non-functional GUI.

	Yesterday : I got done with implementing a simple GUI interface that allows the user to play the game.
	Today     : I want to work further and refine and adjust the workings of the GUI so looks better and to simplify code where possible.
	Obstacles : Nothing in particular as of now. But in fixing and refining many small details, obstacles are expected.
	
Oct 8, 2016
	Yesterday : Added the case when game is won the ActionListener. Tried various Layouts for the GUI, although I could not decide which
				I want to use yet.
	Today     : Further debug the code and add any missing cases/components. Keep working on the GUI.
	Obstacles : Nothing in particular other than how to improve the GUI graphics from basic layouts to something better.
	
Oct 9, 2016
	Yesterday : Tried to refine and debug the code for the GUI and the Model.
	Today     : I plan on completing the first draft of the whole assignment.
	Obstacles : How to get a better looking GUI. How to halt the game when puzzle is solved. How to improve code so it is easier to read
				and neater.
	
Oct 10, 2016
	Yesterday : Submitted the completed assignment.
	Today     : Will proof-read and improve code where possible. Look for missing JavaDocs and potential comments.
	Obstacles : I made the actionListener (and thus the buttons) unresponsive after game completion. I would like to  figure out how to
				disable them.
