# JugPuzzle

JugPuzzle1 contains the code for the puzzle game to be played through the console.

JugPuzzle2 contains the code for the puzzle game to be played with a GUI.

Here is how the game works,

You start with three different jugs, say 1, 2 and 3, with capacities 8, 5 and 3, respectively. Jug 1 is initially filled (so we have 8
units of liquid).

We are able to spill to and from jugs. If the jug being spilling can be emptied into the jug it is spilling in, then it will do so.

Otherwise the jug being spilled into will be filled to its max capacity.

You win the game by spilling to and from the jugs until jug 1 and jug 2 each have 4 units of liquid in them.
